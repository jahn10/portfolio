			<h2>Providence</h2>
			<h3>2018</h3>
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h5>Providence Events</h5>
				<p>This is an event search website aimed to rebrand the city ‘Providence’ in Rhode Island by displaying the vision for Providence. This city honors the voices of the people and collectively thinks about the city’s future direction. Providence is a place built upon innovation and creativity and for many centuries, this allowed many Providence residents to take pride in defining the city by its creative entrepreneurship.  </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Research (Problem)</h5>
				<p>As a student who has been living in Providence for almost 2 years, I found it rather difficult to find an event searching website that is representative of Providence, engaging and personal to users. Providence’s eclectic nature does not shine through on any websites I have used. Also, with a lot of event searching websites being solely informative, it takes the personal aspect out which makes it less engaging to use. My main objective for this new website was to make event searching interesting for users while leaving a lasting impression of Providence as the creative capital.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Research (Survey)</h5>
				<p>This is the first website that appears on the search engine when ‘events in Providence’ is searched. A survey was given to 15 participants to see how representative, engaging and personal they found this Providence web searching website to be. According to the results, the two biggest downfalls of the website is how impersonal and unrepresentative of Providence the website is.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Ideation (Goal)</h5>
				<p>The goal for my redesigned website is to be able to depict Providence as a creative capital and a city that values inclusivity & diversity. To implement the personal quality the other Providence event website lacked, my redesigned website will have a ‘my account’ feature where users can add events, buy tickets, maintain their ticket wallet and create events conveniently.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Ideation (Sketch)</h5>
				<p>I began by sketching out the basic structure I wanted my website to have. Immediately I thought of having a carousel in my website to make it more interactive and engaging. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Ideation (Flowchart)</h5>
				<p>Before designing the website, I wanted to make sure that the interaction flow was refined. This flowchart shows the features/pages that will be on the website. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Ideation (Wireframe)</h5>
				<p>Using my initial sketches as point of reference, I started wireframing the main pages in the flowchart. This is the first visual architecture for the website.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Ideation (Style Guide)</h5>
				<p>The style guide contains the brand’s logo, typography and colors across all platforms (web, mobile and tablet). </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Design (Prototype)</h5>
				<p>The final prototype aims to identify  Providence’s niche and represent its culture. The website is user-friendly as it is clean and straightforward but is not rigid. The gradient, which uses the colors blue and yellow used on the city’s flag, resembles the dynamic and progressive personality Providence has to offer. </p>
